As language models (LMs) are increasingly used as conversational agents, it becomes ever more important to understand their pragmatic reasoning abilities. We propose an evaluation framework derived from Wavelength, a popular communication game where a speaker and a listener communicate about a broad range of concepts in a granular manner. We study a range of LMs on both language comprehension and language production using direct and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, and further explore a Rational Speech Act (RSA) approach to incorporating Bayesian pragmatic reasoning into LM inference. We find that state-of-the-art LMs, but not smaller ones, achieve strong performance on language comprehension, obtaining similar-to-human accuracy and exhibiting high correlations with human judgments even without CoT prompting or RSA. On language production, CoT can outperform direct prompting, and using RSA provides significant improvements over both approaches. Our study helps identify the strengths and limitations in LMs' pragmatic reasoning abilities and demonstrates the potential for improving them with RSA, opening up future avenues for understanding conceptual representation, language understanding, and social reasoning in LMs and humans."

Equipped with a diffusion-based value model that enhances training stability, we demonstrate improved reasoning performance on complex math and coding tasks. Besides, it can also be applied to adapt block-specific models to larger blocks, which improves sampling flexibility. Employing TraceRL, we derive a series of state-of-the-art diffusion language models, namely TraDo. Although smaller than 7B-scale AR models, TraDo-4B-Instruct still consistently outperforms them across complex math reasoning tasks. TraDo-8B-Instruct achieves relative accuracy improvements of 6.1% over Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and 51.3% over Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Through curriculum learning, we also derive the first long-CoT DLM, outperforming Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on MATH500 with an 18.1% relative accuracy gain. To facilitate reproducible research and practical applications, we release a comprehensive open-source framework for building, training, and deploying diffusion LLMs across diverse architectures. The framework integrates accelerated KV-cache techniques and inference engines for both inference and reinforcement learning, and includes implementations of various supervised fine-tuning and RL methods for mathematics, coding, and general tasks.

While the common practice employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a warm-up stage for RL, this decoupled two-stage approach limits interaction between SFT and RL, thereby constraining overall effectiveness. This study introduces a novel method for learning reasoning models that employs bilevel optimization to facilitate better cooperation between these training paradigms. By conditioning the SFT objective on the optimal RL policy, our approach enables SFT to meta-learn how to guide RL's optimization process. During training, the lower level performs RL updates while simultaneously receiving SFT supervision, and the upper level explicitly maximizes the cooperative gain-the performance advantage of joint SFT-RL training over RL alone. Empirical evaluations on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and achieves a better balance between effectiveness and efficiency."

Motivated by recent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning can further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving Reasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based thinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to guide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained details, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train IRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL), which targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate stage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality textual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a subsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed learning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full thinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that natively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first builds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline in the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA performance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF, GenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality and fine-grained fidelity. The code, model weights and datasets will be released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Interleaving-Reasoning-Generation ."

Outcome-based RL, which rewards policies solely for the correctness of the final answer, yields substantial accuracy gains but also induces a systematic loss in generation diversity. This collapse undermines real-world performance, where diversity is critical for test-time scaling. We analyze this phenomenon by viewing RL post-training as a sampling process and show that, strikingly, RL can reduce effective diversity even on the training set relative to the base model. Our study highlights two central findings: (i) a transfer of diversity degradation, where reduced diversity on solved problems propagates to unsolved ones, and (ii) the tractability of the outcome space, since reasoning tasks admit only a limited set of distinct answers. Motivated by these insights, we propose outcome-based exploration, which assigns exploration bonuses according to final outcomes. We introduce two complementary algorithms: historical exploration, which encourages rarely observed answers via UCB-style bonuses, and batch exploration, which penalizes within-batch repetition to promote test-time diversity. Experiments on standard competition math with Llama and Qwen models demonstrate that both methods improve accuracy while mitigating diversity collapse. On the theoretical side, we formalize the benefit of outcome-based exploration through a new model of outcome-based bandits. Together, these contributions chart a practical path toward RL methods that enhance reasoning without sacrificing the diversity essential for scalable deployment."

A large research body is dedicated to the study of insider threats from technological, psychological, and educational perspectives. However, research in this domain has been generally dependent on datasets that are static and limited access which restricts the development of adaptive detection models. This study introduces a novel, ethically grounded approach that uses the large language model (LLM) Claude Sonnet 3.7 to dynamically synthesize syslog messages, some of which contain indicators of insider threat scenarios. The messages reflect real-world data distributions by being highly imbalanced (1% insider threats). The syslogs were analyzed for insider threats by both Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4o, with their performance evaluated through statistical metrics including precision, recall, MCC, and ROC AUC. Sonnet 3.7 consistently outperformed GPT-4o across nearly all metrics, particularly in reducing false alarms and improving detection accuracy. The results show strong promise for the use of LLMs in synthetic dataset generation and insider threat detection."

Paper2Agent transforms research output from passive artifacts into active systems that can accelerate downstream use, adoption, and discovery. Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial effort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own work, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. Paper2Agent addresses this challenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a knowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the associated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify the resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat agent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through natural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We demonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper agents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that leverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy and TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We validate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and can correctly carry out novel user queries. By turning static papers into dynamic, interactive AI agents, Paper2Agent introduces a new paradigm for knowledge dissemination and a foundation for the collaborative ecosystem of AI co-scientists."

Existing safeguards -- retrieval-augmented generation, citations, and uncertainty estimation -- improve transparency but cannot guarantee fidelity: fabricated or misquoted values may still be displayed as if correct. We propose \\textbf{Proof-Carrying Numbers (PCN)}, a presentation-layer protocol that enforces numeric fidelity through mechanical verification. Under PCN, numeric spans are emitted as \\emph{claim-bound tokens} tied to structured claims, and a verifier checks each token under a declared policy (e.g., exact equality, rounding, aliases, or tolerance with qualifiers). Crucially, PCN places verification in the \\emph{renderer}, not the model: only claim-checked numbers are marked as verified, and all others default to unverified. This separation prevents spoofing and guarantees fail-closed behavior. We formalize PCN and prove soundness, completeness under honest tokens, fail-closed behavior, and monotonicity under policy refinement. PCN is lightweight and model-agnostic, integrates seamlessly into existing applications, and can be extended with cryptographic commitments. By enforcing verification as a mandatory step before display, PCN establishes a simple contract for numerically sensitive settings: \\emph{trust is earned only by proof}, while the absence of a mark communicates uncertainty."

We introduce mmBERT, an encoder-only language model pretrained on 3T tokens of multilingual text in over 1800 languages. To build mmBERT we introduce several novel elements, including an inverse mask ratio schedule and an inverse temperature sampling ratio. We add over 1700 low-resource languages to the data mix only during the decay phase, showing that it boosts performance dramatically and maximizes the gains from the relatively small amount of training data. Despite only including these low-resource languages in the short decay phase we achieve similar classification performance to models like OpenAI's o3 and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro. Overall, we show that mmBERT significantly outperforms the previous generation of models on classification and retrieval tasks -- on both high and low-resource languages."

While most prior work relies on simple majority voting or reward model ranking to aggregate solutions, these approaches may only yield limited benefits. In this work, we propose to learn aggregation as an explicit reasoning skill: given a set of candidate solutions, we train an aggregator model to review, reconcile, and synthesize a final, correct answer using reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards. A key ingredient is careful balancing of easy and hard training examples, allowing the model to learn both to recover minority-but-correct answers as well as easy majority-correct answers. Empirically, we find our method, AggLM, outperforms both strong rule-based and reward-model baselines, across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, it generalizes effectively to solutions from differing models, including stronger ones than contained in the training data, all while requiring substantially fewer tokens than majority voting with larger numbers of solutions."

We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of test-time scaling using 12 reasoning models on two knowledge-intensive benchmarks. Our results reveal that increasing test-time computation does not consistently improve accuracy and, in many cases, it even leads to more hallucinations. We then analyze how extended reasoning affects hallucination behavior. We find that reduced hallucinations often result from the model choosing to abstain after thinking more, rather than from improved factual recall. Conversely, for some models, longer reasoning encourages attempts on previously unanswered questions, many of which result in hallucinations. Case studies show that extended reasoning can induce confirmation bias, leading to overconfident hallucinations. Despite these limitations, we observe that compared to non-thinking, enabling thinking remains beneficial. Code and data are available at https://github.com/XuZhao0/tts-knowledge"

Careful alignment of training data and culturally grounded evaluation criteria are vital for developing responsible AI systems. In this study, we introduce the EPT (Evaluation of Persian Trustworthiness) metric, a culturally informed benchmark specifically designed to assess the trustworthiness of LLMs across six key aspects: truthfulness, safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, and ethical alignment. We curated a labeled dataset and evaluated the performance of several leading models - including ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, LLaMA, Mistral, and Qwen - using both automated LLM-based and human assessments. Our results reveal significant deficiencies in the safety dimension, underscoring the urgent need for focused attention on this critical aspect of model behavior.

In this work, we propose COMPACT, which jointly (i) prunes rare vocabulary to shrink embedding/unembedding and (ii) prunes FFN intermediate channels using common-token-weighted activations, aligning importance with the post-pruning token distribution. COMPACT enjoys merits of both depth and width pruning, such as: deployment-friendliness (keeps a standard transformer architecture), scale-adaptivity (trade off vocab vs. FFN pruning), training-free operation with competitive pruning time, and strong memory savings alongside throughput gains. Experiments across Qwen, LLaMA, and Gemma families (0.5B-70B) show state-of-the-art downstream task performance at similar or higher pruning ratios, with substantial reductions in parameters, GPU memory, and end-to-end latency."

Evaluation capabilities that currently exist today (e.g., single pass LLM-as-a-judge) are limited in that they often focus on individual metrics or capabilities, end-to-end outcomes, and are narrowly grounded on the preferences of humans. We argue that to match the agentic capabilities, evaluation frameworks must also be able to reason, probe, iterate, and understand the complex logic passing through these systems over long horizons. In this paper, we present RAFFLES - an evaluation architecture that incorporates reasoning and iterative refinement. Specifically, RAFFLES operates as an iterative, multi-component pipeline, using a central Judge to systematically investigate faults and a set of specialized Evaluators to assess not only the system's components but also the quality of the reasoning by the Judge itself, thereby building a history of hypotheses. We tested RAFFLES against several baselines on the Who&When dataset, a benchmark designed to diagnose the \"who\" (agent) and \"when\" (step) of a system's failure. RAFFLES outperforms these baselines, achieving an agent-step fault pair accuracy of over 43% on the Algorithmically-Generated dataset (a substantial increase from the previously published best of 16.6%) and over 20% on the Hand-Crafted dataset (surpassing the previously published best of 8.8%). These results demonstrate a key step towards introducing automated fault detection for autonomous systems over labor-intensive manual human review."

Our paper addresses this by presenting a novel and reproducible framework for benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) on the task of classifying these complex industrial records. To promote transparency and encourage further research, this framework has been made publicly available as an open-source tool. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs, providing a foundational assessment of their trade-offs in reliability, operational efficiency, and model calibration. Our results quantify a clear performance hierarchy, identifying top models that exhibit high alignment with a benchmark standard and trustworthy, well-calibrated confidence scores. We also demonstrate that classification performance is highly dependent on the task's semantic ambiguity, with all models showing higher consensus on objective component identification than on interpretive maintenance actions. Given that no model achieves perfect accuracy and that calibration varies dramatically, we conclude that the most effective and responsible near-term application is a Human-in-the-Loop system, where LLMs act as a powerful assistant to accelerate and standardise data labelling for human experts, thereby enhancing O&M data quality and downstream reliability analysis."

Rather than relying on error-prone LLMs or complex proof-assistant syntax like Lean and Isabelle, our framework leverages E-prover's saturation capabilities on the vast TPTP axiom library to derive a massive, guaranteed-valid corpus of theorems. Our pipeline is principled and simple: saturate axioms, filter for \"interesting\" theorems, and generate tasks. With no LLMs in the loop, we eliminate factual errors by construction. This purely symbolic data is then transformed into three difficulty-controlled challenges: entailment verification, premise selection, and proof reconstruction. Our zero-shot experiments on frontier models reveal a clear weakness: performance collapses on tasks requiring deep, structural reasoning.

Although extensive methods have improved LLMs' security, they often lead to conservative, rejection-oriented responses that compromise practical usability. This presents a key challenge: how to advance the Pareto frontier between LLMs' usability and security, rather than necessitate a trade-off between them. To address this, we propose the MoGU framework, in which the intra-layer router dynamically allocates weights by sensing hidden states, thereby balancing the contributions of security-optimized and usability-optimized variants. Despite its initial potential, the MoGU framework faces limitations such as parameter redundancy and performance bottlenecks. To overcome these, we further propose an improved MoGU_v2 framework that establishes a tighter coupling between the routers and hidden states. In MoGU_v2, routers are embedded only in layers encoding highly classifiable security features, and backbone modules are activated during router optimization to enable bidirectional adaptation. MoGU_V2 exhibits strong adaptability and stable improvements across various series of LLMs, including mainstream LLMs serving as brains in various applications, on-device LLMs optimized for resource-constrained scenarios, and reasoning LLMs tailored for user interpretability. Meanwhile, even facing risks introduced by Instruction Fine-tuning, MoGU_v2 can easily restore security without compromising the task performance gains via a simple data-mix strategy. These comprehensive improvements highlight MoGU_V2 as a robust and versatile solution for mitigating security risks in real-world applications."

We introduce MachineLearningLM, a portable continued-pretraining framework that equips a general-purpose LLM with robust in-context ML capability while preserving its general knowledge and reasoning for broader chat workflows.\n  Our pretraining procedure synthesizes ML tasks from millions of structural causal models (SCMs), spanning shot counts up to 1,024. We begin with a random-forest teacher, distilling tree-based decision strategies into the LLM to strengthen robustness in numerical modeling. All tasks are serialized with a token-efficient prompt, enabling 3x to 6x more examples per context window and delivering up to 50x amortized throughput via batch inference.\n  Despite a modest setup (Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct with LoRA rank 8), MachineLearningLM outperforms strong LLM baselines (e.g., GPT-5-mini) by an average of about 15% on out-of-distribution tabular classification across finance, physics, biology, and healthcare domains.

However, prior studies have shown that IFT can significantly compromise LLMs' safety, particularly their ability to refuse malicious instructions, raising significant concerns. Recent research into the internal mechanisms of LLMs has identified the refusal direction (r-direction) in the hidden states, which plays a pivotal role in governing refusal behavior. Building on this insight, our study reveals that the r-direction tends to drift during training, which we identify as one of the causes of the associated safety risks. To mitigate such drift, our proposed ProCon method introduces a projection-constrained loss term that regularizes the projection magnitude of each training sample's hidden state onto the r-direction. Our initial analysis shows that applying an appropriate constraint can effectively mitigate the refusal direction drift and associated safety risks, but remains limited by overall performance barriers. To overcome this barrier, informed by our observation of early-stage sharp drift and a data-driven perspective, we introduce a warm-up strategy that emphasizes early-stage strong constraints and broaden the data distribution to strengthen constraint signals, leading to an enhanced ProCon method. Experimental results under various datasets, scenarios, and LLMs demonstrate that our method can significantly mitigate safety risks posed by IFT while preserving task performance gains. Even compared with strong baselines, our method consistently delivers superior overall performance. Crucially, our analysis indicates that ProCon can contribute to stabilizing the r-direction during training, while such an interpretability-driven exploration of LLMs' internal mechanisms lays a solid foundation for future safety research."

Preference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent, off-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective trade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human defined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled comparisons.

We present HAVE (Head-Adaptive Gating and ValuE Calibration), a parameter-free decoding framework that directly addresses both challenges. HAVE introduces head-adaptive gating, which performs instance-level soft reweighing of attention heads, and value calibration, which augments attention with the magnitude of value vectors to approximate write-back contribution. Together, these modules construct token-level evidence aligned with model updates and fuse it with the LM distribution through a lightweight uncertainty-scaled policy. HAVE requires no finetuning and operates in a single forward pass, making it efficient and broadly applicable.

Experiments on WN18RR and FB15k-237 show that SLiNT achieves superior or competitive performance compared with both embedding-based and generation-based baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of structure-aware representation learning for scalable knowledge graph completion."

While large volumes of unchecked data are readily available, indiscriminately using them for fine-tuning risks introducing noise and degrading performance. Strategic data selection is thus crucial, requiring a method that is both accurate and efficient. Existing approaches, categorized as similarity-based and direct optimization methods, struggle to simultaneously achieve these goals. In this paper, we introduce LAMDAS (LLM As an iMplicit classifier for domain-specific DAta Selection), a novel approach that leverages the pre-trained LLM itself as an implicit classifier, thereby bypassing explicit feature engineering and computationally intensive optimization process. LAMDAS reframes data selection as a one-class classification problem, identifying candidate data that \"belongs\" to the target domain defined by a small reference dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LAMDAS not only exceeds the performance of full-data training using a fraction of the data but also outperforms nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines under various scenarios. Furthermore, LAMDAS achieves the most compelling balance between performance gains and computational efficiency compared to all evaluated baselines."

We present the first systematic ablation of LWS and its variants, on a fixed budget of 180M parameters, trained on 5B tokens. All models converge to similar losses and achieve better performance compared to an equal-cost isotropic baseline, without a substantial decrease in training throughput.

In this work, we identify that the key challenge lies in the scarcity of challenging data for information seeking. To address this limitation, we introduce WebExplorer: a systematic data generation approach using model-based exploration and iterative, long-to-short query evolution. This method creates challenging query-answer pairs that require multi-step reasoning and complex web navigation. By leveraging our curated high-quality dataset, we successfully develop advanced web agent WebExplorer-8B through supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning. Our model supports 128K context length and up to 100 tool calling turns, enabling long-horizon problem solving. Across diverse information-seeking benchmarks, WebExplorer-8B achieves the state-of-the-art performance at its scale. Notably, as an 8B-sized model, WebExplorer-8B is able to effectively search over an average of 16 turns after RL training, achieving higher accuracy than WebSailor-72B on BrowseComp-en/zh and attaining the best performance among models up to 100B parameters on WebWalkerQA and FRAMES.

However, the conventional RAG method only injects retrieved documents directly into the model's context, which severely constrains models due to their limited context windows and introduces additional computational overhead through excessively long contexts, thereby disrupting models' attention and degrading performance on downstream tasks. Moreover, many existing benchmarks lack expert annotation and focus solely on individual downstream tasks while real-world legal scenarios consist of multiple mixed legal tasks, indicating conventional benchmarks' inadequacy for reflecting models' true capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose PL-CA, which introduces a parametric RAG (P-RAG) framework to perform data augmentation on corpus knowledge and encode this legal knowledge into parametric vectors, and then integrates this parametric knowledge into the LLM's feed-forward networks (FFN) via LoRA, thereby alleviating models' context pressure. Additionally, we also construct a multi-task legal dataset comprising more than 2000 training and test instances, which are all expert-annotated and manually verified.

Among these, Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) has emerged as a general and effective approach that optimizes the tokens in a suffix to generate jailbreakable prompts. While several improved variants of GCG have been proposed, they all rely on fixed-length suffixes. However, the potential redundancy within these suffixes remains unexplored. In this work, we propose Mask-GCG, a plug-and-play method that employs learnable token masking to identify impactful tokens within the suffix. Our approach increases the update probability for tokens at high-impact positions while pruning those at low-impact positions. This pruning not only reduces redundancy but also decreases the size of the gradient space, thereby lowering computational overhead and shortening the time required to achieve successful attacks compared to GCG. We evaluate Mask-GCG by applying it to the original GCG and several improved variants. Experimental results show that most tokens in the suffix contribute significantly to attack success, and pruning a minority of low-impact tokens does not affect the loss values or compromise the attack success rate (ASR), thereby revealing token redundancy in LLM prompts. Our findings provide insights for developing efficient and interpretable LLMs from the perspective of jailbreak attacks."

Such capabilities are key to unlocking a number of important applications. One such application is Deep Research (DR), which requires extensive search and reasoning over many sources. Our work in this paper focuses on the development of native Autonomous Single-Agent models for DR featuring minimal web crawling and Python tool integration. Unlike multi-agent systems, where agents take up pre-defined roles and are told what to do at each step in a static workflow, an autonomous single-agent determines its next action dynamically based on context, without manual directive. While prior work has proposed training recipes for base or instruction-tuned LLMs, we focus on continual reinforcement learning (RL) of reasoning-optimized models to further enhance agentic skills while preserving reasoning ability. Towards this end, we propose a simple RL recipe with entirely synthetic data, which we apply to various open-source LLMs. Our best variant SFR-DR-20B achieves up to 28.7% on Humanity's Last Exam benchmark.

However, recent studies show that LRMs are prone to suffer from overthinking -- the tendency to overcomplicate simple problems, leading to excessive strategy switching and long, convoluted reasoning traces that hinder their interpretability. To mitigate this issue, we conduct a systematic investigation into the reasoning efficiency of a broad set of LRMs and uncover a common dilemma: the difficulty in balancing multiple generation objectives such as correctness and brevity. Based on this discovery, we propose a test-time scaling method, EDIT (Efficient Dynamic Inference Trimming), which efficiently guides LRMs to identify the shortest correct reasoning paths at test time. EDIT employs constraint-guided generation while jointly tracking length and answer distributions under varying constraints, allowing it to select responses that strike an optimal balance between conciseness and correctness. Extensive experiments across diverse models and datasets show that EDIT substantially enhance the reasoning efficiency, producing compact yet informative outputs that improve readability and user experience."

To overcome these limitations, we introduce REverse-Engineered Reasoning (REER), a new paradigm that fundamentally shifts the approach. Instead of building a reasoning process ``forwards'' through trial-and-error or imitation, REER works ``backwards'' from known-good solutions to computationally discover the latent, step-by-step deep reasoning process that could have produced them.

    "summary": "arXiv:2509.05983v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Code-switching (CS) presents a significant challenge for general Auto-Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. Existing methods often fail to capture the subtle phonological shifts inherent in CS scenarios. The challenge is particularly difficult for language pairs like Vietnamese and English, where both distinct phonological features and the ambiguity arising from similar sound recognition are present. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for Vietnamese-English CS ASR, a Two-Stage Phoneme-Centric model (TSPC). The TSPC employs a phoneme-centric approach, built upon an extended Vietnamese phoneme set as an intermediate representation to facilitate mixed-lingual modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that TSPC consistently outperforms existing baselines, including PhoWhisper-base, in Vietnamese-English CS ASR, achieving a significantly lower word error rate of 20.8\\% with reduced training resources. Furthermore, the phonetic-based two-stage architecture enables phoneme adaptation and language conversion to enhance ASR performance in complex CS Vietnamese-English ASR scenarios."

    "summary": "arXiv:2509.05978v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating 2D images under various conditions; however the impressive performance of these models in 2D is largely enabled by extensive, readily available pretrained foundation models. Critically, comparable pretrained foundation models do not exist for 3D, significantly limiting progress in this domain. As a result, the potential of vision-language models to produce high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images conditioned solely on natural language descriptions remains completely unexplored. Addressing this gap would enable powerful clinical and research applications, such as personalized counterfactual explanations, simulation of disease progression scenarios, and enhanced medical training by visualizing hypothetical medical conditions in realistic detail. Our work takes a meaningful step toward addressing this challenge by introducing a framework capable of generating high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images of synthesized patients guided by free-form language prompts. We adapt state-of-the-art 3D diffusion models with enhancements from Simple Diffusion and incorporate augmented conditioning to improve text alignment and image quality. To our knowledge, this represents the first demonstration of a language-guided native-3D diffusion model applied specifically to neurological imaging data, where faithful three-dimensional modeling is essential to represent the brain's three-dimensional structure. Through results on two distinct neurological MRI datasets, our framework successfully simulates varying counterfactual lesion loads in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and cognitive states in Alzheimer's disease, generating high-quality images while preserving subject fidelity in synthetically generated medical images. Our results lay the groundwork for prompt-driven disease progression analysis within 3D medical imaging."

While adaptive computation methods like early-exiting promise to reduce these costs, they introduce a fundamental conflict: the per-token dynamism intended to save computation often creates system-level bottlenecks that can paradoxically reduce throughput in batched inference. This dissertation resolves this conflict by co-designing adaptive algorithms and model architectures to strike an optimal balance between dynamism and efficiency. To this end, our work first addresses critical sources of overhead in conventional early-exiting by proposing an efficient parallel decoding mechanism. We then show that deep parameter sharing provides an architectural foundation that not only yields compact, parameter-efficient models but also inherently mitigates the critical synchronization issues affecting dynamic inference. Finally, this work presents a unified framework where lightweight routers are pretrained to dynamically assign an optimal recursion depth for each token. This approach establishes a new Pareto frontier between efficiency and performance by effectively optimizing for both adaptive computation and parameter efficiency within a single model."

    "summary": "arXiv:2509.05908v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recently, cross-attention-based contextual automatic speech recognition (ASR) models have made notable advancements in recognizing personalized biasing phrases. However, the effectiveness of cross-attention is affected by variations in biasing information volume, especially when the length of the biasing list increases significantly. We find that, regardless of the length of the biasing list, only a limited amount of biasing information is most relevant to a specific ASR intermediate representation. Therefore, by identifying and integrating the most relevant biasing information rather than the entire biasing list, we can alleviate the effects of variations in biasing information volume for contextual ASR. To this end, we propose a purified semantic correlation joint modeling (PSC-Joint) approach. In PSC-Joint, we define and calculate three semantic correlations between the ASR intermediate representations and biasing information from coarse to fine: list-level, phrase-level, and token-level. Then, the three correlations are jointly modeled to produce their intersection, so that the most relevant biasing information across various granularities is highlighted and integrated for contextual recognition. In addition, to reduce the computational cost introduced by the joint modeling of three semantic correlations, we also propose a purification mechanism based on a grouped-and-competitive strategy to filter out irrelevant biasing phrases. Compared with baselines, our PSC-Joint approach achieves average relative F1 score improvements of up to 21.34% on AISHELL-1 and 28.46% on KeSpeech, across biasing lists of varying lengths."

If such AI collaborators are to be reliable, their behavior over multiturn interactions must be predictable, validated and verified before deployment. Common alignment techniques are typically developed under simplified single-user settings and do not account for the dynamics of long-horizon multiparty interactions. This paper examines how different alignment methods affect LLM agents' effectiveness as partners in multiturn, multiparty collaborations. We study this question through the lens of friction agents that intervene in group dialogues to encourage the collaborative group to slow down and reflect upon their reasoning for deliberative decision-making. Using a roleplay methodology, we evaluate interventions from differently-trained friction agents in collaborative task conversations. We propose a novel counterfactual evaluation framework that quantifies how friction interventions change the trajectory of group collaboration and belief alignment. Our results show that a friction-aware approach significantly outperforms common alignment baselines in helping both convergence to a common ground, or agreed-upon task-relevant propositions, and correctness of task outcomes."

Existing models for TCM utilize traditional algorithms or deep learning techniques to analyze formula relationships, yet lack comprehensive results, such as complete formula compositions and detailed explanations. Although recent efforts have used TCM instruction datasets to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) for explainable formula generation, existing datasets lack sufficient details, such as the roles of the formula's sovereign, minister, assistant, courier; efficacy; contraindications; tongue and pulse diagnosis-limiting the depth of model outputs.

ZhiFangDanTai uses GraphRAG to retrieve and synthesize structured TCM knowledge into concise summaries, while also constructing an enhanced instruction dataset to improve LLMs' ability to integrate retrieved information. Furthermore, we provide novel theoretical proofs demonstrating that integrating GraphRAG with fine-tuning techniques can reduce generalization error and hallucination rates in the TCM formula task.

This paper presents a pretrained quantum context-sensitive embedding model, called QCSE, that captures context-sensitive word embeddings, leveraging the unique properties of quantum systems to learn contextual relationships in languages. The model introduces quantum-native context learning, enabling the utilization of quantum computers for linguistic tasks. Central to the proposed approach are innovative context matrix computation methods, designed to create unique, representations of words based on their surrounding linguistic context. Five distinct methods are proposed and tested for computing the context matrices, incorporating techniques such as exponential decay, sinusoidal modulation, phase shifts, and hash-based transformations. These methods ensure that the quantum embeddings retain context sensitivity, thereby making them suitable for downstream language tasks where the expressibility and properties of quantum systems are valuable resources. To evaluate the effectiveness of the model and the associated context matrix methods, evaluations are conducted on both a Fulani corpus, a low-resource African language, dataset of small size and an English corpus of slightly larger size. The results demonstrate that QCSE not only captures context sensitivity but also leverages the expressibility of quantum systems for representing rich, context-aware language information. The use of Fulani further highlights the potential of QNLP to mitigate the problem of lack of data for this category of languages. This work underscores the power of quantum computation in natural language processing (NLP) and opens new avenues for applying QNLP to real-world linguistic challenges across various tasks and domains."

This question is critical because embedding models are increasingly applied in domains where numbers matter, such as finance and healthcare. For example, Company X's market share grew by 2\\% should be interpreted very differently from Company X's market share grew by 20\\%, even though both indicate growth in market share.

However, existing approaches typically require the questions to be highly similar. In this paper, we extend the scope of method reuse to address questions with low similarity or with hidden similarities that are not explicitly observable. For questions that are similar in a general-specific sense (i.e., broader or narrower in scope), we propose to first separate the question and solution, rather than directly feeding the pair to the LLM. The LLM is then guided to adapt the solution to new but related questions, allowing it to focus on solution transfer rather than question recognition. Furthermore, we extend this approach to cases where questions only share partial features or hidden characteristics. This enables cross-question method reuse beyond conventional similarity constraints. Experimental verification shows that our scope-extension approach increases the probability of filtering out reusable solutions, thereby improving the effectiveness of cross-question method reuse."

This alignment is inherently structured and asymmetric: while multiple consecutive acoustic frames typically correspond to a single linguistic token (many-to-one), certain acoustic transition regions may relate to multiple adjacent tokens (one-to-many). Moreover, acoustic sequences often include frames with no linguistic counterpart, such as background noise or silence may lead to imbalanced matching conditions. In this work, we take a new insight to regard alignment and matching as a detection problem, where the goal is to identify meaningful correspondences with high precision and recall ensuring full coverage of linguistic tokens while flexibly handling redundant or noisy acoustic frames in transferring linguistic knowledge for ASR. Based on this new insight, we propose an unbalanced optimal transport-based alignment model that explicitly handles distributional mismatch and structural asymmetries with soft and partial matching between acoustic and linguistic modalities. Our method ensures that every linguistic token is grounded in at least one acoustic observation, while allowing for flexible, probabilistic mappings from acoustic to linguistic units. We evaluate our proposed model with experiments on an CTC-based ASR system with a pre-trained language model for knowledge transfer. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in flexibly controlling degree of matching and hence to improve ASR performance."

This paper introduces a comprehensive, end-to-end framework for Generative Search Engine Optimization (GSEO) to address this challenge. We make two primary contributions. First, we construct CC-GSEO-Bench, a large-scale, content-centric benchmark, and propose a multi-dimensional evaluation framework that systematically quantifies influence, moving beyond surface-level attribution to assess substantive semantic impact. Second, we design a novel multi-agent system that operationalizes this framework, automating the strategic refinement of content through a collaborative analyze-revise-evaluate workflow. Our empirical analysis using this framework reveals novel insights into the dynamics of content influence, offering actionable strategies for creators and establishing a principled foundation for future GSEO research."

    "summary": "arXiv:2509.05605v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require high quality preference datasets to align with human preferences. However, conventional methods for constructing such datasets face significant challenges: reliance on pre-collected instructions often leads to distribution mismatches with target models, while the need for sampling multiple stochastic responses introduces substantial computational overhead. In this work, we explore a paradigm shift by leveraging inherent regulation of LLMs' representation space for efficient and tailored preference dataset construction, named Icon$^{2}$. Specifically, it first extracts layer-wise direction vectors to encode sophisticated human preferences and then uses these vectors to filter self-synthesized instructions based on their inherent consistency. During decoding, bidirectional inherent control is applied to steer token representations, enabling the precise generation of response pairs with clear alignment distinctions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both alignment and efficiency. Llama3-8B and Qwen2-7B achieve an average win rate improvement of 13.89% on AlpacaEval 2.0 and 13.45% on Arena-Hard, while reducing computational costs by up to 48.1%."

    "summary": "arXiv:2509.05602v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning tasks but are expensive to deploy. Thus small language models (SLMs) are fine-tuned on CoT data generated by LLMs to copy LLMs' abilities. However, these CoT data may include noisy rationales that either fail to substantiate the answers or contribute no additional information to support answer prediction, which leads SLMs to capture spurious correlations between questions and answers and compromise the quality of reasoning. In this work, we propose Chain-of-Thought Correctness Perception Distillation (CoPeD), which aims to improve the reasoning quality of the student model from the perspectives of task setting and data utilization. Firstly, we introduce a correctness-aware task setting that encourages the student model to predict answers based on correct rationales and revise them when they are incorrect. This setting improves the faithfulness of reasoning and allows the model to learn from its mistakes. Then, we propose a Correctness-Aware Weighted loss, which dynamically adjusts the contribution of each training instance based on the combined loss of the rationale and the answer. This strategy encourages the model to focus more on samples where the rationale offers stronger support for the correct answer. Experiments have shown that CoPeD is effective on both in-distribution (IND) and out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmark reasoning datasets."

One view suggests that a new shared naming system establishes an arbitrary link to a specific target, like proper names that cannot extend beyond their bearers. An alternative view proposes that forming a shared way of describing objects involves broader conceptual alignment, reshaping each individual's semantic space in ways that should generalize to new referents. We test these competing accounts in a dyadic communication study (N=302) leveraging the recently-released KiloGram dataset containing over 1,000 abstract tangram images. After pairs of participants coordinated on referential conventions for one set of images through repeated communication, we measured the extent to which their descriptions aligned for undiscussed images. We found strong evidence for generalization: partners showed increased alignment relative to their pre-test labels. Generalization also decayed nonlinearly with visual similarity (consistent with Shepard's law) and was robust across levels of the images' nameability. These findings suggest that ad hoc conventions are not arbitrary labels but reflect genuine conceptual coordination, with implications for theories of reference and the design of more adaptive language agents."

    "summary": "arXiv:2509.05553v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This research addresses a fundamental question in AI: whether large language models truly understand concepts or simply recognize patterns. The authors propose bidirectional reasoning,the ability to apply transformations in both directions without being explicitly trained on the reverse direction, as a test for genuine understanding. They argue that true comprehension should naturally allow reversibility. For example, a model that can change a variable name like userIndex to i should also be able to infer that i represents a user index without reverse training. The researchers tested current language models and discovered what they term cognitive specialization: when models are fine-tuned on forward tasks, their performance on those tasks improves, but their ability to reason bidirectionally becomes significantly worse. To address this issue, they developed Contrastive Fine-Tuning (CFT), which trains models using three types of examples: positive examples that maintain semantic meaning, negative examples with different semantics, and forward-direction obfuscation examples. This approach aims to develop deeper understanding rather than surface-level pattern recognition and allows reverse capabilities to develop naturally without explicit reverse training. Their experiments demonstrated that CFT successfully achieved bidirectional reasoning, enabling strong reverse performance while maintaining forward task capabilities. The authors conclude that bidirectional reasoning serves both as a theoretical framework for assessing genuine understanding and as a practical training approach for developing more capable AI systems."

Addressing the shortcomings of conventional health search engines and the lag in public access to biomedical research, the system integrates diverse sources, including PubMed articles, curated Q&A datasets, and medical encyclopedias ,to retrieve relevant information and generate concise, context-aware responses. The retrieval pipeline uses MiniLM-based semantic embeddings and FAISS vector search, while answer generation is performed by a fine-tuned Mistral-7B-v0.3 language model optimized using QLoRA for efficient, low-resource training. The system supports both general medical queries and domain-specific tasks, with a focused evaluation on breast cancer literature demonstrating the value of domain-aligned retrieval. Empirical results, measured using BERTScore (F1), show substantial improvements in factual consistency and semantic relevance compared to baseline models.

Higher fertility consistently predicts lower accuracy across all models and subjects. We further find that reasoning models (DeepSeek, o1) consistently outperform non-reasoning peers across high and low resource languages in the AfriMMLU dataset, narrowing accuracy gaps observed in prior generations. Finally, translating token inflation to economics, a doubling in tokens results in quadrupled training cost and time, underscoring the token tax faced by many languages. These results motivate morphologically aware tokenization, fair pricing, and multilingual benchmarks for equitable natural language processing (NLP)."

They also generate substantial volumes of staff messages as navigators process patient requests and communicate with the hospital offices following the established protocol restrictions and guidelines. This continuously accumulated large amount of text data can be mined and processed to retrieve insights; however, traditional supervised learning approaches require annotated data, extensive training, and model tuning. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a paradigm shift toward more computationally efficient methodologies for healthcare analytics. This paper presents a multi-stage LLM-based framework that identifies staff message topics and classifies messages by their reasons in a multi-class fashion. In the process, multiple LLM types, including reasoning, general-purpose, and lightweight models, were evaluated. The best-performing model was o3, achieving 78.4% weighted F1-score and 79.2% accuracy, followed closely by gpt-5 (75.3% Weighted F1-score and 76.2% accuracy). The proposed methodology incorporates data security measures and HIPAA compliance requirements essential for healthcare environments. The processed LLM outputs are integrated into a visualization decision support tool that transforms the staff messages into actionable insights accessible to healthcare professionals. This approach enables more efficient utilization of the collected staff messaging data, identifies navigator training opportunities, and supports improved patient experience and care quality."

The prior work has exclusively focused on debates within homogeneous groups of agents, whereas we explore how diversity in model capabilities influences the dynamics and outcomes of multi-agent interactions. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that debate can lead to a decrease in accuracy over time -- even in settings where stronger (i.e., more capable) models outnumber their weaker counterparts. Our analysis reveals that models frequently shift from correct to incorrect answers in response to peer reasoning, favoring agreement over challenging flawed reasoning. These results highlight important failure modes in the exchange of reasons during multi-agent debate, suggesting that naive applications of debate may cause performance degradation when agents are neither incentivized nor adequately equipped to resist persuasive but incorrect reasoning."

In many fields, authorship is distributed among large teams of researchers, some of whom, including paradigmatic senior authors who guide and determine the scope of a project and ultimately vouch for its integrity, may not write a single word. In this paper, we argue that LLM use (under specific conditions) is analogous to a form of senior authorship. On this view, the use of LLMs, even to generate complete drafts of research papers, can be considered a legitimate form of authorship according to the accepted criteria in many fields.

Many of these methods build upon foundational metrics, such as ROUGE, BERTScore, or Perplexity, which often lack the semantic depth necessary to detect hallucinations effectively. In this work, we propose a novel approach inspired by ROUGE that constructs an N-Gram frequency tensor from LLM-generated text. This tensor captures richer semantic structure by encoding co-occurrence patterns, enabling better differentiation between factual and hallucinated content. We demonstrate this by applying tensor decomposition methods to extract singular values from each mode and use these as input features to train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) binary classifier for hallucinations.

However, SAE suffers from semantic entanglement, where individual neurons often mix multiple nonlinear concepts, making it difficult to reliably interpret or manipulate model behaviors.

Unlike existing SAE which requires annotation datasets to filter and interpret activations, we guide semantic disentanglement during training using both annotation datasets and domain knowledge to mitigate the effects of entangled attributes. We design interpretability experiments showing that ProtSAE learns more biologically relevant and interpretable hidden features compared to previous methods. Performance analyses further demonstrate that ProtSAE maintains high reconstruction fidelity while achieving better results in interpretable probing.

While absolute positional encodings struggle with extrapolation to longer sequences due to fixed positional representations, and relative approaches like Alibi exhibit performance degradation on extremely long contexts, the widely-used Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE) introduces oscillatory attention patterns that hinder stable long-distance dependency modelling. We address these limitations through a geometric reformulation of positional encoding. Drawing inspiration from Lorentz transformations in hyperbolic geometry, we propose Hyperbolic Rotary Positional Encoding (HoPE), which leverages hyperbolic functions to implement Lorentz rotations on token representations. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that RoPE is a special case of our generalized formulation. HoPE fundamentally resolves RoPE's slation issues by enforcing monotonic decay of attention weights with increasing token distances. Extensive experimental results, including perplexity evaluations under several extended sequence benchmarks, show that HoPE consistently exceeds existing positional encoding methods. These findings underscore HoPE's enhanced capacity for representing and generalizing long-range dependencies. Data and code will be available."

Automatically classifying disaster related tweets can help emergency services respond faster and more effectively. Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines have been widely used for this task, but they often fail to understand the context or deeper meaning of words, especially when the language is informal, metaphorical, or ambiguous. We posit that, in this context, transformer based models can perform better than traditional ML models. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of transformer based models, including BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa, for classifying disaster related tweets. These models are compared with traditional ML approaches to highlight the performance gap. Experimental results show that BERT achieved the highest accuracy (91%), significantly outperforming traditional models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes (both at 82%). The use of contextual embeddings and attention mechanisms allows transformer models to better understand subtle language in tweets, where traditional ML models fall short. This research demonstrates that transformer architectures are far more suitable for public safety applications, offering improved accuracy, deeper language understanding, and better generalization across real world social media text."

To enable evaluation and development of models assessing review comments, we introduce the RevUtil dataset. We collect 1,430 human-labeled review comments and scale our data with 10k synthetically labeled comments for training purposes. The synthetic data additionally contains rationales, i.e., explanations for the aspect score of a review comment. Employing the RevUtil dataset, we benchmark fine-tuned models for assessing review comments on these aspects and generating rationales. Our experiments demonstrate that these fine-tuned models achieve agreement levels with humans comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, those of powerful closed models like GPT-4o. Our analysis further reveals that machine-generated reviews generally underperform human reviews on our four aspects."

We present an energy-based model (EBM) that learns a smooth energy landscape over a dense semantic corpus of 2.6M guideline-derived questions, enabling the system to decide when to generate or abstain. We benchmark the EBM against a calibrated softmax baseline and a k-nearest neighbour (kNN) density heuristic across both easy and hard abstention splits, where hard cases are semantically challenging near-distribution queries. The EBM achieves superior abstention performance abstention on semantically hard cases, reaching AUROC 0.961 versus 0.950 for softmax, while also reducing FPR@95 (0.235 vs 0.331). On easy negatives, performance is comparable across methods, but the EBM's advantage becomes most pronounced in safety-critical hard distributions. A comprehensive ablation with controlled negative sampling and fair data exposure shows that robustness stems primarily from the energy scoring head, while the inclusion or exclusion of specific negative types (hard, easy, mixed) sharpens decision boundaries but is not essential for generalisation to hard cases. These results demonstrate that energy-based abstention scoring offers a more reliable confidence signal than probability-based softmax confidence, providing a scalable and interpretable foundation for safe RAG systems."

    "summary": "arXiv:2509.04439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new query. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries, promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. We evaluate on ARC-AGI, a benchmark that stresses compositional generalization and abstract reasoning, making it a natural fit for concept memory. Our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design, outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms fixed settings, supporting the hypothesis that accumulating and abstracting patterns enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement.

In an effort to evaluate the merits of this claim, social science researchers have largely focused on whether LLM-generated survey data corresponds to that of a human counterpart whom the LLM is prompted to represent. In contrast, we address a more fundamental question: Do agents maintain internal consistency, retaining similar behaviors when examined under different experimental settings? To this end, we develop a study designed to (a) reveal the agent's internal state and (b) examine agent behavior in a basic dialogue setting. This design enables us to explore a set of behavioral hypotheses to assess whether an agent's conversation behavior is consistent with what we would expect from their revealed internal state. Our findings on these hypotheses show significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across model families and at differing model sizes. Most importantly, we find that, although agents may generate responses matching those of their human counterparts, they fail to be internally consistent, representing a critical gap in their capabilities to accurately substitute for real participants in human-subject research. Our simulation code and data are publicly accessible."

Our analysis reveals that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments\", ``length-scaling'' and entropy dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this, we propose HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. HICRA significantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that focusing on this strategic bottleneck is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. Furthermore, we validate semantic entropy as a superior compass for measuring strategic exploration over misleading metrics such as token-level entropy."

Therefore, it is important to build trustworthy AI-generated text detection systems. Existing methods neglect stylistic modeling and mostly rely on static thresholds, which greatly limits the detection performance. In this paper, we propose the Mixture of Stylistic Experts (MoSEs) framework that enables stylistics-aware uncertainty quantification through conditional threshold estimation. MoSEs contain three core components, namely, the Stylistics Reference Repository (SRR), the Stylistics-Aware Router (SAR), and the Conditional Threshold Estimator (CTE). For input text, SRR can activate the appropriate reference data in SRR and provide them to CTE. Subsequently, CTE jointly models the linguistic statistical properties and semantic features to dynamically determine the optimal threshold. With a discrimination score, MoSEs yields prediction labels with the corresponding confidence level. Our framework achieves an average improvement 11.34% in detection performance compared to baselines. More inspiringly, MoSEs shows a more evident improvement 39.15% in the low-resource case.

However, existing approaches such as GRPO often suffer from zero gradients. This problem arises primarily due to fixed clipping bounds for token-level probability ratios and the standardization of identical rewards, which can lead to ineffective gradient updates and underutilization of generated responses. In this work, we propose Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization(DCPO), which introduces a dynamic clipping strategy that adaptively adjusts clipping bounds based on token-specific prior probabilities to enhance token-level exploration, and a smooth advantage standardization technique that standardizes rewards across cumulative training steps to improve the response-level effective utilization of generated responses. DCPO achieved state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks based on four different models. In particular, DCPO achieved an Avg@1 of 46.7 under greedy decoding and an Avg@32 of 38.8 under 32 times sampling on the AIME24 benchmark, surpassing DAPO (36.7/31.6), GRPO (36.7/32.1) and GSPO (40.0/34.9) on the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model.

Furthermore, DCPO achieved an average 28% improvement in the nonzero advantage over GRPO in four models, doubled the training efficiency over DAPO, and significantly reduced the token clipping ratio by an order of magnitude compared to both GRPO and DAPO, while achieving superior performance.

This is because the existing datasets, used for the training of these systems, focus on surface-level emotion recognition without addressing the complex verbal-visual incongruence (mismatch) patterns useful for empathic understanding. In this paper, we present E-THER, the first Person-Centered Therapy-grounded multimodal dataset with multidimensional annotations for verbal-visual incongruence detection, enabling training of AI systems that develop genuine rather than performative empathic capabilities. The annotations included in the dataset are drawn from humanistic approach, i.e., identifying verbal-visual emotional misalignment in client-counsellor interactions - forming a framework for training and evaluating AI on empathy tasks. Additional engagement scores provide behavioral annotations for research applications. Notable gains in empathic and therapeutic conversational qualities are observed in state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), such as IDEFICS and VideoLLAVA, using evaluation metrics grounded in empathic and therapeutic principles. Empirical findings indicate that our incongruence-trained models outperform general-purpose models in critical traits, such as sustaining therapeutic engagement, minimizing artificial or exaggerated linguistic patterns, and maintaining fidelity to PCT theoretical framework."

Most current approaches focus narrowly on risks posed by malicious actors, often framing risks as adversarial events and relying on defensive refusals. However, in real-world settings, risks also come from non-malicious users seeking help while under psychological distress (e.g., self-harm intentions). In such cases, the model's response can strongly influence the user's next actions. Simple refusals may lead them to repeat, escalate, or move to unsafe platforms, creating worse outcomes. We introduce Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA), a human-centric paradigm that protects against malicious misuse while actively guiding vulnerable users toward safe and helpful results. Implemented in Oyster-I (Oy1), CSA combines game-theoretic anticipation of user reactions, fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and interpretable reasoning control, turning safety into a trust-building process. Oy1 achieves state-of-the-art safety among open models while retaining high general capabilities. On our Constructive Benchmark, it shows strong constructive engagement, close to GPT-5, and unmatched robustness on the Strata-Sword jailbreak dataset, nearing GPT-o1 levels. By shifting from refusal-first to guidance-first safety, CSA redefines the model-user relationship, aiming for systems that are not just safe, but meaningfully helpful.

In this work, we systematically quantify these behavioral changes by manipulating the perceived context of prompts. We introduce a methodology that uses a linear probe to score prompts on a continuous scale from \"test-like\" to \"deploy-like\" and leverage an LLM rewriting strategy to shift these prompts towards a more natural, deployment-style context while preserving the original task. Using this method, we achieved a 30% increase in the average probe score across a strategic role-playing dataset after rewriting. Evaluating a suite of state-of-the-art models on these original and rewritten prompts, we find that rewritten \"deploy-like\" prompts induce a significant and consistent shift in behavior. Across all models, we observed an average increase in honest responses of 5.26% and a corresponding average decrease in deceptive responses of 12.40%. Furthermore, refusal rates increased by an average of 6.38%, indicating heightened safety compliance. Our findings demonstrate that evaluation awareness is a quantifiable and manipulable factor that directly influences LLM behavior, revealing that models are more prone to unsafe or deceptive outputs in perceived test environments. This underscores the urgent need for more realistic evaluation frameworks to accurately gauge true model alignment before deployment."

The token-level MoE is a standard upcycling MoE structure with a shared expert and a novel gate weight normalization approach that aids in the final fusion with the segment-level MoE. The segment-level MoE incorporates two innovative designs to better capture the syntactic structure and contextual patterns of programming languages: First, using a sliding window to partition the input token sequence into multiple segments; Then, adopting an expert-choice routing strategy that allows experts to select the top-k segments.

Emotional understanding is thus essential for improving human-machine interaction. Most empathetic speech LLMs rely on massive datasets, demanding high computational cost. A key challenge is to build models that generate empathetic responses with limited data and without large-scale training.

Despite growing interest in accessibility and inclusivity, the development of robust translation systems remains hindered by the limited availability of parallel corpora which align natural language with sign language data. Existing methods often struggle to generalize in these data-scarce environments, as the few datasets available are typically domain-specific, lack standardization, or fail to capture the full linguistic richness of sign languages. To address this limitation, we propose Advanced Use of LLMs for Sign Language Translation (AulSign), a novel method that leverages Large Language Models via dynamic prompting and in-context learning with sample selection and subsequent sign association. Despite their impressive abilities in processing text, LLMs lack intrinsic knowledge of sign languages; therefore, they are unable to natively perform this kind of translation. To overcome this limitation, we associate the signs with compact descriptions in natural language and instruct the model to use them. We evaluate our method on both English and Italian languages using SignBank+, a recognized benchmark in the field, as well as the Italian LaCAM CNR-ISTC dataset. We demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models in low-data scenario.

To enhance the reasoning performance of LLMs, diverse Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based fine-tuning approaches have been proposed to address the limited generalization capability of LLMs trained solely via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Despite their effectiveness, two major limitations hinder the advancement of LLMs. First, vanilla RL-based approaches ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and incorporate unstable reasoning path sampling, which typically results in model collapse, unstable training process, and suboptimal performance. Second, existing SFT approaches generally overemphasize the annotated CoT, potentially leading to performance degradation due to insufficient exploitation of potential CoT. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive learning with annotated CoT-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning approach, i.e., \\TheName{}, to enhance the reasoning performance of LLMs while addressing the aforementioned limitations. Specifically, we propose learning a representation for each CoT. Based on this representation, we design novel contrastive signals to guide the fine-tuning process. Our approach not only fully exploits the available annotated CoT but also stabilizes the fine-tuning procedure by incorporating an additional unsupervised learning signal. We conduct comprehensive experiments and in-depth analysis with three baseline approaches, two foundation models, and two datasets to demonstrate significant advantages of \\TheName{} in terms of robustness, performance (up to 10.15\\%), and efficiency (up to 30.62\\%).

Traditional IR methods-whether sparse or dense-often fall short in retrieval accuracy, as it requires not only capturing semantic similarity but also performing fine-grained reasoning over document structure and domain-specific knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened up new opportunities for retrieval with multi-step reasoning, where the model ranks passages through iterative reasoning about which information is most relevant to a given query. However, there exists no benchmark to evaluate such capabilities in the financial domain. To address this gap, we introduce FinAgentBench, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating retrieval with multi-step reasoning in finance -- a setting we term agentic retrieval. The benchmark consists of 3,429 expert-annotated examples on S&P-100 listed firms and assesses whether LLM agents can (1) identify the most relevant document type among candidates, and (2) pinpoint the key passage within the selected document. Our evaluation framework explicitly separates these two reasoning steps to address context limitations. This design enables to provide a quantitative basis for understanding retrieval-centric LLM behavior in finance. We evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art models and further demonstrated how targeted fine-tuning can significantly improve agentic retrieval performance. Our benchmark provides a foundation for studying retrieval-centric LLM behavior in complex, domain-specific tasks for finance."

Traditional machine-learning based approaches to performing this task require a large corpus of annotated data and lack the ability to easily incorporate domain specific information in the construction of the model. Therefore, creating a model for JERE is often labor intensive, time consuming, and elaboration intolerant. In this paper, we propose harnessing the capabilities of generative pretrained large language models (LLMs) and the knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities of Answer Set Programming (ASP) to perform JERE. We present a generic workflow for JERE using LLMs and ASP. The workflow is generic in the sense that it can be applied for JERE in any domain. It takes advantage of LLM's capability in natural language understanding in that it works directly with unannotated text. It exploits the elaboration tolerant feature of ASP in that no modification of its core program is required when additional domain specific knowledge, in the form of type specifications, is found and needs to be used. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed workflow through experiments with limited training data on three well-known benchmarks for JERE. The results of our experiments show that the LLM + ASP workflow is better than state-of-the-art JERE systems in several categories with only 10\\% of training data. It is able to achieve a 2.5 times (35\\% over 15\\%) improvement in the Relation Extraction task for the SciERC corpus, one of the most difficult benchmarks."

This paper presents the first systematic review of TF alignment methods, categorizing them by stages of pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding. For each stage, we provide a detailed examination from the viewpoint of LLMs and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), highlighting their mechanisms and limitations.

Recent KGQA methods primarily follow either retrieve-then-reason paradigm, relying on GNNs or heuristic rules for static paths extraction, or dynamic path generation strategies that use large language models (LLMs) with prompting to jointly perform retrieval and reasoning. However, the former suffers from limited adaptability due to static path extraction and lack of contextual refinement, while the latter incurs high computational costs and struggles with accurate path evaluation due to reliance on fixed scoring functions and extensive LLM calls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive MCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates symbolic search with adaptive path evaluation for efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR employs a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) backbone guided by an LLM-based planner, which selects top-$k$ relevant relations at each step to reduce search space. To improve path evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight Transformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plausibility estimation by jointly encoding the question and relation sequence through cross-attention, enabling the model to capture fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop reasoning. Furthermore, to alleviate the scarcity of high-quality supervision, DAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path refinement mechanism that periodically generates training signals from partial paths explored during search, allowing the scorer to continuously adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA benchmarks show that DAMR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods."

This creates a fundamental mismatch as LLMs' self-attention mechanism inevitably distributes focus across all pairs, diluting attention on critical relationships, particularly in datasets with complex dependencies or semantically ambiguous features. To address this limitation, we propose GraDe (Graph-Guided Dependency Learning), a novel method that explicitly integrates sparse dependency graphs into LLMs' attention mechanism. GraDe employs a lightweight dynamic graph learning module guided by externally extracted functional dependencies, prioritizing key feature interactions while suppressing irrelevant ones. Our experiments across diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that GraDe outperforms existing LLM-based approaches by up to 12% on complex datasets while achieving competitive results with state-of-the-art approaches in synthetic data quality. Our method is minimally intrusive yet effective, offering a practical solution for structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs."

We first design Conditional Step-level Self-refinement, a fine-grained sequential scaling method guided by process verification. On top of its effectiveness, we further combine it with other classical parallel scaling methods at the step level, to introduce a novel inference paradigm called Hybrid Test-Time Scaling.

To quantify this gap, we introduce Entity-Context Divergence (ECD), a metric that measures the extent to which retrieved information is accurately reflected in model outputs. We systematically evaluate contemporary LLMs on their ability to preserve factual consistency in retrieval-augmented settings, a capability we define as RAG-ability. Our empirical analysis reveals that RAG-ability remains low across most LLMs, highlighting significant challenges in entity retention and context fidelity. This paper introduces Radiant (Retrieval AugmenteD entIty-context AligNmenT), a novel framework that merges RAG with alignment designed to optimize the interplay between retrieved evidence and generated content. Radiant extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to teach LLMs how to integrate provided additional information into subsequent generations.

The data was gathered through analyzing peer-reviewed medical articles, clinical case studies, and disease-symptom association reports. Only the verified medical sources were included in the dataset, while those from non-peer-reviewed and anecdotal sources were excluded. The dataset is structured in a tabular format, where the first column represents diseases, and the remaining columns represent symptoms. Each symptom cell contains a binary value, indicating whether a symptom is associated with a disease. Thereby, this structured representation makes the dataset very useful for a wide range of applications, including machine learning-based disease prediction, clinical decision support systems, and epidemiological studies. Although there are some advancements in the field of disease-symptom datasets, there is a significant gap in structured datasets for the Bangla language.

    "summary": "arXiv:2505.17746v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a range of natural language processing tasks. However, recent advances demonstrate that further gains particularly in complex reasoning tasks require more than merely scaling up model sizes or training data. One promising direction is to enable models to think during the reasoning process. Recently, Quiet STaR significantly improves reasoning by generating token-level thought traces, but incurs substantial inference overhead. In this work, we propose Fast Quiet STaR, a more efficient reasoning framework that preserves the benefits of token-level reasoning while reducing computational cost. Our method introduces a curriculum learning based training strategy that gradually reduces the number of thought tokens, enabling the model to internalize more abstract and concise reasoning processes. We further extend this approach to the standard Next Token Prediction (NTP) setting through reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, resulting in Fast Quiet-STaR NTP, which eliminates the need for explicit thought token generation during inference. Experiments on four benchmark datasets with Mistral 7B and Qwen2.5 7B demonstrate that Fast Quiet-STaR consistently outperforms Quiet-STaR in terms of average accuracy under the same inference time budget. Notably, Fast Quiet-STaR NTP achieves an average accuracy improvement of 9\\% on Mistral 7B and 5.7\\% on Qwen2.5 7B, while maintaining the same inference latency.

    "summary": "arXiv:2505.17656v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: As large language models (LLMs) often generate plausible but incorrect content, error detection has become increasingly critical to ensure truthfulness. However, existing detection methods often overlook a critical problem we term as self-consistent error, where LLMs repeatedly generate the same incorrect response across multiple stochastic samples. This work formally defines self-consistent errors and evaluates mainstream detection methods on them. Our investigation reveals two key findings: (1) Unlike inconsistent errors, whose frequency diminishes significantly as the LLM scale increases, the frequency of self-consistent errors remains stable or even increases. (2) All four types of detection methods significantly struggle to detect self-consistent errors. These findings reveal critical limitations in current detection methods and underscore the need for improvement. Motivated by the observation that self-consistent errors often differ across LLMs, we propose a simple but effective cross-model probe method that fuses hidden state evidence from an external verifier LLM. Our method significantly enhances performance on self-consistent errors across three LLM families."

However, existing evaluations of speech interaction models lack instances mimicking real scenarios and predominantly focus on the quality of their textual responses, overlooking critical aspects of vocal performance. To address this gap, we propose VocalBench, a comprehensive benchmark to assess the speech conversational abilities, comprising 9,400 carefully curated instances across four key dimensions: semantic quality, acoustic performance, conversational abilities, and robustness. It covers a broad range of fundamental skills essential for effective vocal interactions. For the evaluation scheme, we propose several objective evaluation indicators and incorporate an additional LLM-as-a-judge approach to score open-ended questions. Experimental results on 15 mainstream systems reveal significant variability, each exhibiting distinct strengths and weaknesses, and provide valuable insights to guide future research in speech interaction systems."

We present the first systematic study of language mixing in RLMs, examining its patterns, impact, and internal causes across 15 languages, 7 task difficulty levels, and 18 subject areas, and show how all three factors influence language mixing. Moreover, we demonstrate that the choice of reasoning language significantly affects performance: forcing models to reason in Latin or Han scripts via constrained decoding notably improves accuracy. Finally, we show that the script composition of reasoning traces closely aligns with that of the model's internal representations, indicating that language mixing reflects latent processing preferences in RLMs. Our findings provide actionable insights for optimizing multilingual reasoning and open new directions for controlling reasoning languages to build more interpretable and adaptable RLMs."

Therefore, we introduce PhantomCircuit, a novel framework designed to comprehensively analyze and detect knowledge overshadowing. By innovatively employing knowledge circuit analysis, PhantomCircuit dissects the function of key components in the circuit and how the attention pattern dynamics contribute to the overshadowing phenomenon and its evolution throughout the training process.

We show that the choice of regularization method plays a crucial role: when trained on formal languages with standard regularization ($L_1$, $L_2$, or none), expressive architectures not only fail to converge to correct solutions but are actively pushed away from perfect initializations. In contrast, applying the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to balance model complexity with data fit provides a theoretically grounded regularization method. Using MDL, perfect solutions are selected over approximations, independently of the optimization algorithm. We propose that unlike existing regularization techniques, MDL introduces the appropriate inductive bias to effectively counteract overfitting and promote generalization."

OpenDeception jointly evaluates both the deception intention and capabilities of LLM-based agents by inspecting their internal reasoning process. Specifically, we construct five types of common use cases where LLMs intensively interact with the user, each consisting of ten diverse, concrete scenarios from the real world. To avoid ethical concerns and costs of high-risk deceptive interactions with human testers, we propose to simulate the multi-turn dialogue via agent simulation. Extensive evaluation of eleven mainstream LLMs on OpenDeception highlights the urgent need to address deception risks and security concerns in LLM-based agents: the deception intention ratio across the models exceeds 80%, while the deception success rate surpasses 50%. Furthermore, we observe that LLMs with stronger capabilities do exhibit a higher risk of deception, which calls for more alignment efforts on inhibiting deceptive behaviors."

To achieve this goal, we replace the majority of self-attention layers in the common Transformer model architecture with Mamba layers that perform constant computation and require constant memory per generated token.

We learn to reason over a story's condensed information and generate a detailed plan for the next chapter. Our reasoning is evaluated via the chapters it helps a story-generator create, and compared against non-trained and supervised finetuning (SFT) baselines.

Rather than caching keys and values separately, MLA stores their compressed latent representations, reducing memory overhead while maintaining the performance. While MLA improves memory efficiency without compromising language model accuracy, its major limitation lies in its integration during the pre-training phase, requiring models to be trained from scratch. This raises a key question: can we use MLA's benefits fully or partially in models that have already been pre-trained with different attention mechanisms? In this paper, we propose X-EcoMLA to deploy post training distillation to enable the upcycling of Transformer-based attention into an efficient hybrid MLA variant through lightweight post-training adaptation, bypassing the need for extensive pre-training. We demonstrate that leveraging the dark knowledge of a well-trained model can enhance training accuracy and enable extreme KV cache compression in MLA without compromising model performance. The experimental results show that our proposed method can effectively compress the KV cache while preserving the performance on the benchmarks; specifically, for Llama3.2-1B-Instruct baseline, a 6.4x compression achieves the same average score by using only 3.6B training tokens and 70 GPU hours on AMD MI300, whereas a 10.6x compression have less than 0.1% average score drop with 7B training tokens and 140 GPU hours.

Using common benchmarks such as Who Is Harry Potter? and TOFU, we demonstrate that in a strong auditor setting such attacks can elicit any information from the LLM, regardless of the deployed unlearning algorithm or whether the queried content was originally present in the training corpus. We further show that STA with just a few soft tokens (1-10) can elicit random strings over 400 characters long, indicating that STAs must be used carefully to effectively audit unlearning.

Experimental results demonstrate that our approach, utilizing only about 2% to 40% of the data required by other methods, achieves SOTA performance on RewardBench. Furthermore, our training method enhances the general capabilities of the model by constructing complicated judge task, and the judge signals provided by our model have significantly enhanced the downstream DPO training performance of our internal models in our test to optimize policy model with Judge Model. We also open-source our model weights and training data to facilitate further research."

Evaluating four VLMs, we find that while these models demonstrate the ability to recognize geographic information from images, achieving up to 53.8% accuracy in city prediction, they exhibit significant biases. Specifically, performance is substantially higher for economically developed and densely populated regions compared to less developed (-12.5%) and sparsely populated (-17.0%) areas. Moreover, regional biases of frequently over-predicting certain locations remain. For instance, they consistently predict Sydney for images taken in Australia, shown by the low entropy scores for these countries. The strong performance of VLMs also raises privacy concerns, particularly for users who share images online without the intent of being identified.

However, they face significant challenges in lifelong editing due to their incompatibility with LLM parameters that dynamically change during the editing process. To address this, we observed that hypernetwork-based lifelong editing aligns with reinforcement learning modeling and proposed RLEdit, an RL-based editing method. By treating editing losses as rewards and optimizing hypernetwork parameters at the full knowledge sequence level, we enable it to precisely capture LLM changes and generate appropriate parameter updates. Our extensive empirical evaluation across several LLMs demonstrates that RLEdit outperforms existing methods in lifelong editing with superior effectiveness and efficiency, achieving a 59.24% improvement while requiring only 2.11% of the time compared to most approaches.

However, due to the verbosity of LLMs, the resulting reasoning chains can be long, making it harder to verify the reasoning steps and trace issues resulting from dependencies between the steps that may be farther away in the sequence of steps. Importantly, mathematical reasoning allows each step to be derived from a small set of premises, which are a subset of the preceding steps in the reasoning chain. In this paper, we present a framework that identifies the premises for each step, to improve the evaluation of reasoning. We restructure conventional linear reasoning chains into Premise Augmented Reasoning Chains (PARC) by introducing premise links, resulting in a directed acyclic graph where the nodes are the steps and the edges are the premise links. Through experiments with a PARC-based dataset that we built, namely PERL (Premises and ERrors identification in LLMs), we demonstrate that LLMs can reliably identify premises within complex reasoning chains. In particular, even open-source LLMs achieve 90% recall in premise identification. We also show that PARC helps to identify errors in reasoning chains more reliably. The accuracy of error identification improves by 6% to 16% absolute when step-by-step verification is carried out in PARC under the premises. Our findings highlight the utility of premise-centric representations in addressing complex problem-solving tasks and open new avenues for improving the reliability of LLM-based reasoning evaluations."

We explore various prompting strategies and further investigate whether using prompts in regional languages enhances the models cultural sensitivity and response quality.

Current error classification methods rely on static and predefined categories, which limit their ability to capture the full spectrum of error patterns in mathematical reasoning. To enable systematic error analysis, we collect error samples from 15 different LLMs of varying sizes across four distinct MWP datasets using multiple sampling strategies. Based on this extensive collection, we introduce MWPES-300K, a comprehensive dataset containing 304,865 error samples that cover diverse error patterns and reasoning paths. To reduce human bias and enable fine-grained analysis of error patterns, we propose a novel framework for automated dynamic error classification in mathematical reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that dataset characteristics significantly shape error patterns, which evolve from basic to complex manifestations as model capabilities increase.

Prior work has shown that models struggle at two-hop question-answering without CoT. This capability is so basic that if it was a fundamental limitation, it would imply that many complex agentic tasks would similarly require CoT. We investigate LLM latent reasoning capabilities using two-hop question answering as a case study. Previous work on the gap between latent and externalized two-hop reasoning produced mixed evidence with inconclusive results. In this paper, we introduce a controlled setting for investigating two-hop reasoning in LLMs, where a positive result provides definitive evidence for latent reasoning. We fine-tune LLMs (including Llama 3 8B and GPT-4o) on synthetic facts and test two-hop reasoning over these facts. By using synthetic facts, we rule out memorization and reasoning shortcuts as explanations for two-hop performance. We observe a nuanced picture: Models fail to compose two synthetic facts, but can succeed when one fact is synthetic and the other is natural. These results demonstrate that LLMs are undeniably capable of latent two-hop reasoning, although it remains unclear how this ability scales with model size. Finally, we highlight a lesson for researchers studying LLM reasoning: when drawing conclusions about LLM latent reasoning, one must be careful to avoid both spurious successes (that stem from memorization and reasoning shortcuts) and spurious failures (that may stem from artificial experimental setups, divorced from training setups of frontier LLMs)."

Interestingly, GPT-4o consistently outperforms 4o-mini, particularly in MskCal, demonstrating a greater ability to handle numerical reasoning with masked text. This underscores the crucial role of semantic cues in the reasoning process of LLMs. Our study illuminates the interplay between background knowledge and reasoning ability in masked text processing, paving the way for a deeper understanding of LLM capabilities and limitations, and highlighting the need for more robust evaluation methods to accurately assess their true comprehension abilities."

To aid the testing of autonomous vehicles in simulation, we design a natural language interface, using an instruction-following large language model, to assist a non-coding domain expert in synthesising the desired scenarios and vehicle behaviours. We show that using it to convert utterances to the symbolic program is feasible, despite the very small training dataset. Human experiments show that dialogue is critical to successful simulation generation, leading to a 4.5 times higher success rate than a generation without engaging in extended conversation."

Existing work highly relies on training with the multi-lingual ability-related data, which may not be available for low-resource languages. To solve it, we propose a Multi-lingual Abilities Extraction and Combination approach, named as MAEC. Our key idea is to decompose and extract language-agnostic ability-related weights from LLMs, and combine them across different languages by simple addition and subtraction operations without training. Specifically, our MAEC consists of the extraction and combination stages. In the extraction stage, we firstly locate key neurons that are highly related to specific abilities, and then employ them to extract the transferable ability-related weights. In the combination stage, we further select the ability-related tensors that mitigate the linguistic effects, and design a combining strategy based on them and the language-specific weights, to build the multi-lingual ability-enhanced LLM. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on LLaMA-3 8B on mathematical and scientific tasks in both high-resource and low-resource lingual scenarios. Experiment results have shown that MAEC can effectively and efficiently extract and combine the advanced abilities, achieving comparable performance with PaLM.

Specifically, we propose to use a deep generative model such as large language models (LLMs) to efficiently generate treatments and use their internal representation for subsequent causal effect estimation. We show that the knowledge of this true internal representation helps disentangle the treatment features of interest, such as specific sentiments and certain topics, from other possibly unknown confounding features. Unlike existing methods, the proposed GenAI-Powered Inference (GPI) methodology eliminates the need to learn causal representation from the data, and hence produces more accurate and efficient estimates. We formally establish the conditions required for the nonparametric identification of the average treatment effect, propose an estimation strategy that avoids the violation of the overlap assumption, and derive the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator through the application of double machine learning. Finally, using an instrumental variables approach, we extend the proposed GPI methodology to the settings in which the treatment feature is based on human perception. The GPI is also applicable to text reuse where an LLM is used to regenerate existing texts. We conduct simulation and empirical studies, using the generated text data from an open-source LLM, Llama~3, to illustrate the advantages of our estimator over state-of-the-art causal representation learning algorithms."

To handle this issue, we concentrate on behavior simulation in robotics to analyze and validate the logic behind robot behaviors, aiming to achieve preliminary evaluation before deploying resource-intensive simulators and thus enhance simulation efficiency. In this paper, we propose BeSimulator, a modular and novel LLM-powered framework, as an attempt towards behavior simulation in the context of text-based environments. By constructing text-based virtual environments and performing semantic-level simulation, BeSimulator can generalize across scenarios and achieve long-horizon complex simulation. Inspired by human cognition paradigm, it employs a ``consider-decide-capture-transfer'' four-phase simulation process, termed Chain of Behavior Simulation (CBS), which excels at analyzing action feasibility and state transition. Additionally, BeSimulator incorporates code-driven reasoning to enable arithmetic operations and enhance reliability, and reflective feedback to refine simulation. Based on our manually constructed behavior-tree-based simulation benchmark, BTSIMBENCH, our experiments show a significant performance improvement in behavior simulation compared to baselines, ranging from 13.60% to 24.80%.

To address these limitations, we explore using Large Language Models (LLMs), and in particular, their abilities of doing in-context learning, for conversational code generation. As a first step, we define RATS, the ``Repetitive Assembly Task'', a 2D building task designed to lay the foundation for simulating industry assembly scenarios. In this task, a `programmer' instructs a cobot, using natural language, on how a certain assembly is to be built; that is, the programmer induces a program, through natural language. We create a dataset that pairs target structures with various example instructions (human-authored, template-based, and model-generated) and example code. With this, we systematically evaluate the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs for synthesising this kind of code, given in-context examples. Evaluating in a simulated environment, we find that LLMs are capable of generating accurate `first order code' (instruction sequences), but have problems producing `higher-order code' (abstractions such as functions, or use of loops)."

AC commonly centers on two task families: Affective Understanding (AU) and Affective Generation (AG). While fine-tuned pre-trained language models (PLMs) have achieved solid AU performance, they often generalize poorly across tasks and remain limited for AG, especially in producing diverse, emotionally appropriate responses. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g., ChatGPT and LLaMA) has catalyzed a paradigm shift by offering in-context learning, broader world knowledge, and stronger sequence generation. This survey presents an NLP-oriented overview of AC in the LLM era. We (i) consolidate traditional AC tasks and preliminary LLM-based studies; (ii) review adaptation techniques that improve AU/AG, including Instruction Tuning (full and parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA, P-/Prompt-Tuning), Prompt Engineering (zero/few-shot, chain-of-thought, agent-based prompting), and Reinforcement Learning. For the latter, we summarize RL from human preferences (RLHF), verifiable/programmatic rewards (RLVR), and AI feedback (RLAIF), which provide preference- or rule-grounded optimization signals that can help steer AU/AG toward empathy, safety, and planning, achieving finer-grained or multi-objective control. To assess progress, we compile benchmarks and evaluation practices for both AU and AG. We also discuss open challenges-from ethics, data quality, and safety to robust evaluation and resource efficiency-and outline research directions. We hope this survey clarifies the landscape and offers practical guidance for building affect-aware, reliable, and responsible LLM systems."

Previous work argues that generalizable multilingual evaluation sets should contain languages with diverse typological properties. However, 'typologically diverse' language samples have been found to vary considerably in this regard, and popular sampling methods are flawed and inconsistent. We present a language sampling framework for selecting highly typologically diverse languages given a sampling frame, informed by language typology. We compare sampling methods with a range of metrics and find that our systematic methods consistently retrieve more typologically diverse language selections than previous methods in NLP. Moreover, we provide evidence that this affects generalizability in multilingual model evaluation, emphasizing the importance of diverse language sampling in NLP evaluation."

ResearchArena models the process in three stages: (1) information discovery, identifying relevant literature; (2) information selection, evaluating papers' relevance and impact; and (3) information organization, structuring knowledge into hierarchical frameworks such as mind-maps. Notably, mind-map construction is treated as a bonus task, reflecting its supplementary role in survey-writing. To support these evaluations, we construct an offline environment of 12M full-text academic papers and 7.9K survey papers. To ensure ethical compliance, we do not redistribute copyrighted materials; instead, we provide code to construct the environment from the Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus (S2ORC). Preliminary evaluations reveal that LLM-based approaches underperform compared to simpler keyword-based retrieval methods, though recent reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 show slightly better zero-shot performance.

However, existing contrastive learning-based and prompt-based LM approaches tend to be biased, often assigning a primary role to time series modality while treating text modality as secondary. We classify these approaches under a temporal-primary paradigm, which may overlook the unique and critical task-relevant information embedded in text modality like clinical reports, thus failing to fully leverage mutual benefits and complementarity of different modalities. To fill this gap, we propose a novel textual-temporal multimodal learning paradigm that enables either modality to serve as the primary while being enhanced by the other, thereby effectively capturing modality-specific information and fostering cross-modal interaction. In specific, we design MedualTime, a language model composed of dual adapters to implement temporal-primary and textual-primary modeling simultaneously. Within each adapter, lightweight adaptation tokens are injected into the top layers of LM to encourage high-level modality fusion. The shared LM pipeline by dual adapters not only achieves adapter alignment but also enables efficient fine-tuning, reducing computational resources. Empirically, MedualTime demonstrates superior performance on medical data, achieving notable improvements of 8% accuracy and 12% F1 in supervised settings. Furthermore, MedualTime's transferability is validated by few-shot label transfer experiments from coarse-grained to fine-grained medical data. https://github.com/start2020/MedualTime"

To achieve this, we use a common model of concept semantics as linearly represented in an LM's latent space. In particular, we take the view that natural language generation traces a trajectory in this continuous semantic space, realized by the language model's hidden activations. This view permits a control-theoretic treatment of text generation in latent space, in which we propose a lightweight, gradient-free intervention that dynamically steers trajectories away from regions corresponding to undesired meanings. In particular, we propose to directly intervene the activations of the token that is being generated in embedding space in an online fashion. Crucially, we do not simply steer activations towards a desirable region. Instead, our method relies on classical techniques from control theory to precisely control activations in a context-dependent way, and guarantees that they are brought into a specific pre-defined region of embedding space that corresponds to allowed semantics. Our intervention is computed in closed-form according to an optimal controller formulation, minimally impacting generation time. This control of the activations in embedding space allows for fine-grained steering of attributes of the generated sequence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on different objectives-- toxicity avoidance and sentiment control-- while maintaining text quality."

Recent approaches to adapt autoregressive language models (LMs) into strong text embedding models have largely had the requirement to modify the LM architecture to be bidirectional. We challenge this premise by introducing \"echo embeddings\" which converts autoregressive LMs into high quality text embedding models without changing the architecture or requiring fine-tuning. By repeating the input and extracting embeddings from the repeated tokens -- which have access to all original tokens -- echo embeddings improve over classical LM embeddings by over 5% in zero-shot settings. Our zero-shot embeddings nearly match those obtained by bidirectionally-converted LMs that undergo additional masked-language modeling training. Echo embeddings are also compatible with supervised fine-tuning, matching or outperforming bidirectionally-converted LMs in an apples-to-apples comparison, even with an identical compute budget during training and inference. Overall, repetition is a simple and effective strategy to circumvent the need for bidirectional attention in embedding models, paving the way towards a unified architecture for all NLP tasks."

We introduce Multi-Domain Diffusion (MDD), a method with dual purposes: i) reconstructing any missing views for new data objects, and ii) enabling learning in semi-supervised contexts with arbitrary supervision configurations. MDD achieves these objectives by exploiting the noise formulation of diffusion models, specifically modeling one noise level per domain. Similar to existing domain translation approaches, MDD learns the translation between any combination of domains. However, unlike prior work, our formulation inherently handles semi-supervised learning without modification by representing missing views as noise in the diffusion process.
